Comment:  The dxsamples tarball is distributed separately from the main
 OpenDX files, and does not contain a license file.  (Well, it does
 contain COPYING, but it is empty.)  David Thompson, one of the upstream
 authors, replied to a query about the distribution license as follows:

 Daniel,
 .
 Sorry no one has commented. I'll comment since I was in the meetings
 during the open source planning. Yes the license does encompass the
 samples as well.

 IBM PUBLIC LICENSE - Open Visualization Data Explorer VERSION 1.0
 .
 THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM
 PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT").  ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
 OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
 .
 1. DEFINITIONS.
 .
 "Contribution" means:
   a) in the case of International Business Machines Corporation
      ("IBM"), the Original Program, and
   b) in the case of each Contributor,
        i)   changes to the Program, and
        ii)  any additions to the Program that are distributed in
             conjunction with the Program under this Agreement;
      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
      and are distributed by that particular Contributor.
 A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was made or added
 to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
 Contributor's behalf.  Contributions do not include additions to the
 Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
 conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and
 (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
 .
 "Contributor" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the
 Program.
 .
 "Licensed Patents" mean those claims of patents licensable by a
 Contributor which are necessarily infringed by each Contribution that
 both originates from and is distributed by that particular
 Contributor, if any, as well as claims of patents licensable by a
 Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the Contributor's
 Contribution when combined with the Program.
 .
 "Original Program" means the original version of the software
 accompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source code,
 object code and documentation, if any.
 .
 "Program" means the Original Program and Contributions.
 .
 "Recipient" means the entity that receives the Program under this
 Agreement, including all Contributors.
 .
 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
 .
   a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
      license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, distribute,
      publicly display, publicly perform and sublicense the Contribution
      of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
 .
   b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
      if any, in source code and object code form.  The patent license
      shall not apply to the combination of the Contribution with any
      other software except that it shall apply to the combination of the
      Contribution and the Program where, at the time the Contribution is
      added, the addition of the Contribution causes the combination of
      the Contribution and the Program to be covered by the Licensed
      Patents.  Nor shall any machine, apparatus or other hardware be
      licensed hereunder.
 .
   c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
      property rights or otherwise.  As a condition precedent to
      exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient
      hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
      property rights needed, if any.  For example, if a third party
      patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
      before distributing the Program.
 .
   d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
 .
 3. REQUIREMENTS
 .
 A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
 under its own license agreement, provided that:
   a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
   b) its license agreement:
 .
        i)   effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
             warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
             warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
             implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
             fitness for a particular purpose;
 .
        ii)  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
             liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
             incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
 .
        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
             are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other
             party; and
 .
        iv)  states that source code for the Program is available from
             such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in
             a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
             for software exchange.
 .
 When the Program is made available in source code form:
 .
   a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
 .
   b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
      Program.
 .
 Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location
 in the Program:
 .
   (C) Copyright 1989, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation
   and others.  All Rights Reserved.
 .
 In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator
 of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows
 subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
 .
 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 .
 This Agreement does not prohibit any Contributor from including the
 Program in a commercial product offering (including distribution in
 object code form under a license agreement other than this Agreement),
 provided that such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby
 agrees to indemnify, defend and hold every other Contributor
 ("Indemnified Contributor") harmless from and against any losses,
 damages, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) and costs
 (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
 actions brought against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent
 caused by the terms, conditions, acts or omissions of such Commercial
 Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a
 commercial product offering, excluding any Losses arising from
 intellectual property claims relating to the Program, provided that
 any Indemnified Contributor: a) promptly notifies the Commercial
 Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allows the Commercial
 Contributor to control, and cooperates with the Commercial Contributor
 in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.  The
 Indemnified Contributor shall have the right to participate at its own
 expense.
 .
 5. NO WARRANTY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
 PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
 WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
 OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  Each Recipient is solely
 responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
 distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
 exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
 the risks and costs of program errors, damage to or loss of data,
 programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
 operations.
 .
 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
 ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
 INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
 WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
 LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
 NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
 DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
 HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. GENERAL
 .
 If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not effect the validity or enforceability of
 the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
 action by the parties hereto such provision shall be reformed to the
 minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
 respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
 counterclaim in a lawsuit), then the patent licenses granted by that
 Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as
 of the date such litigation is filed.  In addition, If Recipient
 institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
 itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
 hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
 rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
 litigation is filed.
 .
 All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
 fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
 Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
 time after becoming aware of such non-compliance.  If all Recipient's
 rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
 and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
 However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
 granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
 survive.
 .
 IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement
 from time to time.  Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
 distinguishing version number.  The Program (including Contributions)
 may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
 under which it was received.  In addition, after a new version of the
 Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the
 Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.  No one
 other than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement.  Except as
 expressly stated in Sections 2.a) and 2.b) above, Recipient receives
 no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor
 under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
 otherwise.  All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
 Agreement are reserved.
 .
 This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
 the intellectual property laws of the United States of America.  No
 party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
 more than one year after the cause of action arose.  Each party waives
 its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.  Recipient
 agrees to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations,
 including without limitation all export and import laws, rules and
 regulations.
